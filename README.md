### README from Project in case Word causes issues

Code Quality
I am using AirBNB style guide:
I enforced this through using ESLint and Prettier, which automatically detected any issues and forced me to fix these throughout the project. https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

Other Notes
-	Screencast: In my filter, I did not demo filtering by list (favs or reviewed) but it does work, logic is the same as other filters.
-	Screencast: At the end when I logged out, the state from when I signed up at the beginning remained. I have since fixed this.
-	Screencast: In my screen to Edit a review, I removed the ability to delete the review from here after recording as it didn’t work
However: It does work in the Review component (deleting a photo for a given review) as demo’ed. Just wanted to mention it here since I made the change after recording.
